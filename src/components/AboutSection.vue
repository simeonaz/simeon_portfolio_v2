        I'm a passionate full stack developer dedicated to creating comprehensive digital solutions
        that marry robust technical architecture with intuitive user experience. My approach
        combines technical precision with a holistic vision of projects, from backend design to user
        interface development.

        Currently, I work as a Full Stack Developer at

          >TOK Services</a
        >, where I contribute to innovative projects. I work across the entire technology stack,
        designing robust architectures while developing responsive and accessible user interfaces. I
        also serve as a <span class="font-bold">team lead</span>, directing both the development and
        design teams.
      </p>

        Previously, I completed a one-year internship at
        <a
          class="font-bold text-slate-200 hover:text-teal-300 focus-visible:text-teal-300"

          >Euphorbia Group</a
        >, where I had the opportunity to develop various technical solutions - from internal
        company projects to SaaS applications for external clients. This experience allowed me to
        gain a comprehensive understanding of the development lifecycle and adapt to different
        technical and business contexts.
      </p>

      <p>
        With two years of professional experience, I continue to deepen my skills in both frontend
        and backend development, constantly seeking to create solutions where robust engineering
        meets design elegance. I aspire to build digital products that solve real problems while
        delivering a smooth and accessible user experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me exploring new technologies, making music,
        watching a football match, or enjoying walks in nature.
